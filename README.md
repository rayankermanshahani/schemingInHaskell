# Scheming In Haskell

My own fully-functional Scheme interpreter that implements a decent subset of [R5RS Scheme](https://conservatory.scheme.org/schemers/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/).

Inspired by George Hotz's "scheming in haskell" [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QsC_VeYL4g) and this [book](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours).
